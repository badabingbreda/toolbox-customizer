Compile static CSS from customizer settings instead of inline

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add CSS-styles for your Customizer settings based on a LESS file. LESS is highly efficient and can be used to write rules for
when certain CSS properties need to be added, or not. LESS is also specifically aimed at working with CSS properties, so that you can work faster and smarter
with colors and units.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Open the Customizer and use the settings to change the look of your page or pages
3. Click publish to commit the changes to a seperate CSS file that will be enqueued rather than created inline on each page-call
